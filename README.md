# IITBHU Wifi Logger
The current system has a firewall authentication system and this makes us enter the credentials again and again. We might have also lost our wifi network on curcial time due to this xD. In order to avoid the boring task and losing the network during important times, I created a shell script which currently suports Debian and Mac. I'm planning to make a cross platform GUI for the same so that it can work on other operating sytems as well.

## How to run the script
- First task is to make the script executable
```
chmod +x ./authentication.sh.x 
# Make sure you open the terminal in the folder which contains the script
```
